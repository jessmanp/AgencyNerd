# AGENCY nerd Web Application

AGENCY nerd was originally developed by a State Farm agent in 2011. He was frustrated he could not compensate his team members the same way he was compensated. He felt that the best way to attract talented team members was to sell them on the concept of building their "mini book" within his book of business. In order to do this, he needed an accurate way of paying them that would reward employees for writing good business and charging them back when he was charged back. The only other option available was an excel program that cost over $600/year and was only as accurate as the team member’s entries. He designed a program that was developed and now owned by Sea Cloud Media, Inc. Sea Cloud Media’s team of developers have created a state of the art, cloud based platform now being used by hundreds of agents across the country. The software has been developed specifically for agents and allows them to track new & renewal policies/premium by team member. This unique feature provides the agent with a tool to assign policies to specific team members. A commission % can be customized for new and renewing policies. This simple concept allows agents to improve their team member retention as well as reduce their lapse/cancellation. Most importantly it will show the agent the direct profit & loss each team member is contributing to the agency.
